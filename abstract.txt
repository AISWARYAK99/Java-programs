*Abstract methods have no implementation in superclass

*They are subclass responsibility

*The implementation should be there in subclass by overriding these methods

*Thus abstract methods have no method body in superclass

*Objects are not created for abstract classes

*No abstract constructors or no abstract static methods(static methods are those that have complete definition and we cant override these methods in the class that implements it)

*Any subclass of an abstract class must either implement all of the abstract methods in superclass or should be declared as abstract

* we can create an abstract class and no problem if there is no abstract methods.It can have normal methods too

*Although abstract classes cant be used to instantiate objects it can be used to create object references.

*Java RunTime polymorphism(dynamic binding) is implemented through use of superclass references.
