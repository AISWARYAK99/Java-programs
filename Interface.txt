*Interface is a collection of constants and """""abstract methods""""".

*They only have method header and no method body.

*Methods do not need to use abstract keyword.They are abstract in default.

*In interface every methods have public visibility in default.No need to mention it.

*A class can implement an interface.

*No problem if a class implements multiple interfaces.

*All methods in interface should be defined by the class implementing it and that class could have its own method too.

*Objects of interfaces cant be created.

*Normally in interfaces abstract methods are alloewd but we can create static methods inside a interface that doent overrides on the class which implement it.

*Java8 allows interfaces to have """""static methods and default methods""""".

*Default methods are methods of complete defintion.We donot need to implement this methods in implementation classes mandatorily.
